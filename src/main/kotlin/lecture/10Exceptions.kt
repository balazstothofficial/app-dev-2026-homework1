/**
 * # Exceptions
 * Kotlin inherited exceptions from Java, but only has unchecked exceptions.
 * My advice: Try to avoid throwing any exceptions on your own.
 *
 * ## Tasks:
 * - What are alternatives to using exceptions?
 * - Can the code crash? Fix any crashes.
 *
 * ## Resources:
 * - [Exceptions](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/exceptions.html)
 * - [(Infix functions)](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/functions.html#infix-notation)
