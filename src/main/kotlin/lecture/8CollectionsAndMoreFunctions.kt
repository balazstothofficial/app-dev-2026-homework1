/**
 * # Collections
 * Read-only lists, sets and maps are an idiomatic way to store a variable number of
 *  items in a data structure. Read-only interfaces do not guarantee that the underlying
 *  collection is immutable.
 *
 * ## Tasks:
 * - Create a read-only list, a read-only set and a read-only map with example values.
 *   The list should contain [String]s.
 * - What are use-cases for these types of collections?
 *   When would be mutable collections the better option?
 *   When would be arrays the better option?
 * - We want to work on the list. Do the following tasks without using a loop:
 *      1. Filter out all elements, that have two or less characters.
 *      2. Append "end" to all remaining elements.
 *      3. Combine all strings to a single list of [Char]s.
 * - Define a generic function `printEach` that takes a list and prints all its values.
 * - Define a generic function `mapEverySecond` that operates on a list of type `List<A>`.
 *   The function takes two transformations of type `(A) -> B`:
 *      - The first function is applied to elements at even indices.
 *      - The second function is applied to elements at odd indices.
 *   The result is a new list of type `List<B>` containing the transformed elements.
 * - Change `printEach` and `mapEverySecond` to be extension functions.
 * - The functions [let], [run], [apply], and [also] are idiomatic in Kotlin.
 *   What can they be used for?
 *   What is the difference between them?
